Secret of Monkey Island (EGA) Randomiser
########################################

Finally, a mod which takes one of the most beloved adventure games of all time and makes it near-unplayable! You're welcome.

This is more of an early look than a finished product; right now the room shuffle only affects Mêlée island, and there are a few holes in the linkages caused by non-matching script hotspots that I need to fix (e.g. the cutscenes, the Scumm Bar kitchen door, making the troll bridge to be a link between two rooms...). Object switching is a bit of a nightmare;  in SCUMM pick-upable objects are the same thing as hotspots, so they have a bunch of room stuff attached and the player has to be located in the same room in order to pick them up.

Secret of Monkey Island (EGA) Randomiser was originally released for `DOSember Game Jam 2025 <https://itch.io/jam/dosember-game-jam>`_.
